### Project Abstract (150-200 words)

Deconstruct Hawai’is image of a post-racial “utopia” based on it’s blended, multi-ethinic population, and instead focus on it as a result of colonization, cultural genocide, and exploitation of land and people from Westerners. To understand the current racial and economic status of Hawai’i, there will be comparisons between the racial population of the island and its median income level for ‘foreign-born’, ‘locals’ (loosely describes all citizens and residents of Hawaiian Islands who were born on the islands or long term residents), and indigenous/native people of the Hawaiian islands from the year 2000 and 2020.

From gentrification to industrial pollution, discover how certain historical events led to Native Hawaiians displacement due to overcrowding and over-tourism. At this point, Hawaii has become a preferred place for the international 1% to buy property. Today, the median price for a single-family home in Honolulu sits at $992,500, while the median household income in Honolulu is $87,470.

While doing research, consider how concepts of race and culture have evolved since the year 2000, as majority of Native Hawaiian population is a result of interracial partnerships and marriages (about 66%-98% being multiethnic or mulriracial, U.S. Census 2000), and have also been categorized as Pacific Islanders, Polynesians, Oceanic People, and Asian-Pacific Islanders. Recognize that U.S. Census Data may not accurately represent who is ‘pure-blood’ Hawai’ian, and take into account their experiences may be vastly different from ‘locals’.
